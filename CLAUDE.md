# CLAUDE.md — AuditPoppy

Operating guide for working in this repo. **`DESIGN.md` is the source of truth** — read it
fully before any work; when a design decision changes, update DESIGN.md in the same change.

> **Boundary:** AuditPoppy is a standalone project that runs *on* AgentsPoppy (never
> forks it). The mailpoppy / traffic-poppy / other poppy repos are READ-ONLY reference
> material: copy patterns from them, never modify them from here.

## What this is

SOC 2 **audit-readiness** for the customer's own AWS account, from inside their own AWS
account — gap report, continuous evidence collection, policy pack, auditor export. The
anti-Vanta wedge: *compliance evidence that never leaves your cloud.*

## The two laws that bind every word and grant

1. **Naming law (DESIGN §0):** never "SOC 2 compliant/certified" — only a licensed CPA firm
   attests. Copy says "audit-ready", "evidence for your SOC 2 audit". Test-pin it like the
   platform dossier does.
2. **Wide READ, narrow WRITE (DESIGN §4):** reads may be wide but must be enumerated and
   reasoned; writes only to its own stack/bucket/table + service enablement. **No
   auto-remediation, ever** — a wide-write compliance tool destroys its own trust story.

## Status

- ✅ DESIGN.md drafted (2026-09-02). **Name DECIDED: AuditPoppy** (id
  `com.auditpoppy.desktop`; tagline carries "SOC 2", the name never does — §11.1).
  **Licensing DECIDED: three tiers — personal free (watermarked exports); under-10-employee
  companies free with mandatory AgentsPoppy registration (identity known, granted license,
  clean exports); 10+ paid. No DRM** (§8). **Price DECIDED: $499/yr — as the /admin-editable commerce-db value; NEVER hardcode a
  dollar amount in poppy code, manifest, listing copy or screenshots.** **Policy pack in v1: INCLUDED. Host-enforced
  `machine: "aws-only"`: YES — first enforced-chip poppy.** All §11 questions decided;
  the design is complete. Next: phase 0 de-risk, then the full build in its own session.
- Next: phase 0 de-risk (DESIGN §12) — live-enable Config/Security Hub/Audit Manager in a
  throwaway account, measure real costs for a week, verify teardown semantics.
