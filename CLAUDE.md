# CLAUDE.md — AuditPoppy

Operating guide for working in this repo. **`DESIGN.md` is the source of truth** — read it
fully before any work; when a design decision changes, update DESIGN.md in the same change.

> **Boundary:** AuditPoppy is a standalone project that runs *on* AgentsPoppy (never
> forks it). The mailpoppy / traffic-poppy / other poppy repos are READ-ONLY reference
> material: copy patterns from them, never modify them from here.

## What this is

SOC 2 **audit-readiness** for the customer's own AWS account, from inside their own AWS
account — gap report, continuous evidence collection, policy pack, auditor export. The
anti-Vanta wedge: *compliance evidence that never leaves your cloud.*

## The two laws that bind every word and grant

1. **Naming law (DESIGN §0):** never "SOC 2 compliant/certified" — only a licensed CPA firm
   attests. Copy says "audit-ready", "evidence for your SOC 2 audit". Test-pin it like the
   platform dossier does.
2. **Wide READ, narrow WRITE (DESIGN §4):** reads may be wide but must be enumerated and
   reasoned; writes only to its own stack/bucket/table + service enablement. **No
   auto-remediation, ever** — a wide-write compliance tool destroys its own trust story.

## Status

- ✅ DESIGN.md drafted (2026-09-02) — awaiting founder answers to §11 (name, pricing,
  freemium split, policy pack in v1, Host-enforced machine declaration).
- Next: phase 0 de-risk (DESIGN §12) — live-enable Config/Security Hub/Audit Manager in a
  throwaway account, measure real costs for a week, verify teardown semantics.
